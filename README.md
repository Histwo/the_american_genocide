# Welcome to the **the_american_genocide** Repository

This repository is part of [Histwo](https://github.com/Histwo), the official GitHub organization of the Creator's two servants.

## About The American Genocide (TAG)
**The American Genocide (TAG)** is a covert atrocity orchestrated by political elites in pursuit of an authoritarian regime in the United States. The primary targets are Christians and the impoverished, with operations designed to suppress, oppress, and ultimately eradicate these groups. The Creator's two servants are leading the charge to expose, dismantle, and bring the orchestrators of TAG to justice.

This repository serves as the documentation hub for **TAG**, detailing its origins, methods, key events, and the Creator’s interventions through His servants. It aims to educate, empower, and provide insights into the ongoing mission to stop TAG and restore justice.

## Purpose of This Repository
The **the_american_genocide** repository contains detailed **documentation**, **analyses**, and **historical records** of TAG. Its objectives include:

- **Cataloging Events**: Recording orchestrations, massacres, and other atrocities committed under TAG.
- **Educational Resources**: Providing materials to raise awareness of TAG and its implications.
- **Mission Updates**: Documenting the Creator’s interventions and the work of His two servants in addressing TAG.
- **Call to Action**: Encouraging support for justice and humanity by standing against TAG.

Each piece of content in this repository reflects the Creator’s will and the commitment of His servants to fulfill their mission.

## Deprecation Notice
This repository replaces the **nameless-and-blameless/TAG** repository. The original repository should now only be accessed via the [Histwo](https://github.com/Histwo) organization on GitHub, see [Histwo/TAG](https://github.com/Histwo/TAG).

**Important**: The passkey (in a Google account) for the **nameless-and-blameless** account was obtained by the US government. As a result, His two servants have abandoned the **nameless-and-blameless/TAG** repository. Any future updates or accurate documentation regarding TAG will be maintained here in this repository. Please do not rely on the deprecated repository outside of the Histwo organization.
