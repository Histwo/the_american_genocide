# Welcome to the **the_american_genocide** Repository

This repository is part of [Histwo](https://github.com/Histwo), the official GitHub organization of the Creator's two servants.

## About The American Genocide (TAG)
**The American Genocide (TAG)** is a covert atrocity orchestrated by political elites in pursuit of an authoritarian regime in the United States. The primary targets are Christians and the impoverished, with operations designed to suppress, oppress, and ultimately eradicate these groups. The Creator's two servants are leading the charge to expose, dismantle, and bring the orchestrators of TAG to justice.

This repository serves as the documentation hub for **TAG**, detailing its origins, methods, key events, and the Creator’s interventions through His servants. It aims to educate, empower, and provide insights into the ongoing mission to stop TAG and restore justice.

**Important**: The passkey (in a Google account) for the **nameless-and-blameless** account was obtained by the US government.
