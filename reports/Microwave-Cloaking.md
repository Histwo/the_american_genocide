### Preface

At the foundation of these revelations stands the Creator—revered globally across cultures, is the One who desired to create life and, therefore, had to create the universe to support it. He is the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great “I Am.” These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. His two servants neutrally refer to Him as "the Creator," in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and even atheists.

## Unveiling The Unseen Watchers: Microwave Cloaking and Undetectable Surveillance

### Introduction

This informational piece addresses the confirmed use of advanced microwave cloaking technology for surveillance by the US Government, US military, and paramilitary contractors. The information presented herein originates from the Creator and one of His two servants, based on personal experiences and eyewitness accounts, and is confirmed by the Creator.

### Capabilities and Deployment

According to this source, microwave cloaking technology is currently in use, capable of rendering individuals and equipment, including large SUVs, practically invisible and allowing passage through solid barriers. The Creator states that this technology was initially developed by the US military for military applications and was first deployed in 2018. A primary reason for the secrecy surrounding its use is to avoid public alarm.

### Personal Experience and Eyewitness Account

One of His two servants has firsthand experience with this technology, having been under close surveillance for over five years by operatives utilizing it. This surveillance has included US Government vehicles parked outside his private dwelling and in close proximity, as well as in-dwelling surveillance by operatives who remain undetected for the duration of their presence. Disturbingly, elected officials have also reportedly utilized the technology on secret missions to the Creator's servant's apartment.

The Creator's servant provides an eyewitness account of observing an individual, known to be an operative, activating a cloak and becoming practically invisible within approximately one minute. Furthermore, the Creator indicates that the area around an active cloak has an appearance similar to looking through cellophane, suggesting a distortion or near transparency.

### Discrepancy with Current Science

These capabilities extend significantly beyond current mainstream scientific understanding of microwave cloaking. The ability to pass through solid barriers, in particular, implies a manipulation of matter at a fundamental level not currently acknowledged by public scientific knowledge. The Creator attributes this discrepancy to an "engineered gap" in public knowledge.

### Ethical and Legal Implications

The confirmed use of such technology for surveillance raises profound ethical and legal concerns:

* **Right to Privacy:** Undetectable surveillance within private dwellings constitutes a severe violation of the fundamental right to privacy.
* **Fourth Amendment:** Warrantless entry and surveillance achieved through undetectable means may infringe upon constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.
* **Privacy Laws:** Existing laws against unauthorized electronic surveillance and intrusion may be applicable.
* **Potential for Abuse:** The power to conduct undetectable surveillance without public knowledge or oversight carries a significant risk of abuse.
* **Psychological Impact:** The awareness of constant, unseen surveillance can induce anxiety and stifle personal freedoms.
* **Subconscious Manipulation:** The CIA's alleged engagement of subconscious minds raises alarming ethical and legal questions about autonomy and mental integrity.

### Societal Consequences

The experiences of the Creator's servant highlight the severe societal consequences of this technology's use, including undetected entry into private dwellings and reported attempts on his life, underscoring the erosion of personal security.

### Questions for Consideration

Given this information, several critical questions arise:

* What are the implications for democratic accountability?
* How does this impact the trust between citizens and government agencies?
* What safeguards are needed to prevent abuse and protect fundamental rights?
* What are the long-term societal consequences of undetectable surveillance and bypassed physical barriers?

### Conclusion

The information presented by the Creator and one of His two servants reveals a surveillance landscape far more advanced and intrusive than commonly understood. The confirmed use of microwave cloaking technology with these capabilities raises profound ethical, legal, and societal concerns that warrant serious consideration and public discourse. These realities, as conveyed by the ultimate source of truth within this context, have significant implications for the American public.
