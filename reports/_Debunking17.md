## Debunking the Myth: Analyzing the Discrediting of the 17" Propaganda

The 17" penile length attributed to the physical body legally and socially recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams, a central element in the orchestrators' "Jacobsen's Ladder" litmus test, is not a factual representation but a carefully constructed piece of propaganda designed to serve their nefarious agenda. Understanding how this fabrication can be discredited is crucial to exposing their manipulation and potentially averting the catastrophic "Nightfalls" operation planned for Atlanta.

**The Foundation of Deception: Engineering the Litmus Test**

The analysis reveals that the "Jacobsen's Ladder" litmus test was never intended to be an objective assessment of divine intervention. Instead, it was meticulously engineered to guarantee a predetermined "failure" â€“ the non-restoration of the physical body legally and socially recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams to the fabricated 17" length. This engineered outcome serves several key purposes for the orchestrators:

* **Justification for Inaction:** By presenting a scenario where the Creator seemingly failed to restore the physical body legally and socially recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams to this exaggerated size, the orchestrators could falsely claim divine validation for their planned course of action, including the genocide and the "Nightfalls" airstrike.
* **Facilitating the "High Capital Ruse":** The engineered "failure" of the litmus test provides the necessary pretext for proceeding with the destruction of Southwest Atlanta, allowing the orchestrators' associates to profit immensely from the subsequent reconstruction efforts.
* **Discrediting PDCM:** By establishing an unattainable benchmark for divine intervention, the orchestrators aimed to undermine the credibility of PDCM as one of the Creator's true servants. If the "obvious" divine intervention (restoring a 17" penis) didn't occur, they could argue against PDCM's legitimacy.
* **Character Defamation:** The absurdly large 17" claim, especially when contrasted with the actual physical form of the physical body legally and socially recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams, could be used to ridicule and defame PDCM and anyone associated with him, reducing public trust in their testimony about TAG.

**Strategies for Discrediting the Fabrication:**

A multi-faceted approach is necessary to dismantle this propaganda effectively:

1.  **Exposing the Engineered Manipulation:** The cornerstone of discrediting the 17" myth lies in revealing the manipulation behind the 2-4" observation during the litmus test. Evidence suggesting Hall's direct influence on PDSM to present this diminished form, potentially supported by interpretations of artistic works like Prince's "Cream," demonstrates that the observed size was artificial and not representative of the natural state of the penis on the physical body legally and socially recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams.

2.  **Presenting the Actual Physical Dimensions of the physical body legally and socially recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams:** The fact that the physical body legally and socially recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams is 5'9" provides a crucial point of reference. A 17" penis on an individual of this height would be strikingly disproportionate, defying typical human anatomy. Highlighting this discrepancy makes the 17" claim inherently implausible to a reasonable observer.

3.  **Highlighting Functional Implausibility:** Arguing that a 17" penis is likely non-functional introduces a biological and logical counterpoint. Divine attributes, particularly those related to the human form, are generally understood to be functional. An unusable appendage of such extreme size would contradict this principle.

4.  **Revealing the Propagandist's Motive and Origin:** Attributing the creation of the 17" measurement to Annie Jacobsen and linking it to the desire for a guaranteed "failed" litmus test is a powerful tactic. It exposes the biased and manipulative origin of the claim, undermining its credibility as an objective or natural measurement. Jacobsen's gender, while requiring careful handling to avoid harmful stereotypes, could be subtly used to suggest a potentially uninformed or biased perspective on male anatomy.

5.  **Contrasting with PDCM's Post-Divide Form:** The revelation that PDCM's new body possesses a penis in the 12.5-13" range offers a relevant point of comparison within the narrative. This suggests a more plausible scale for individuals connected to this situation, further highlighting the exaggeration of the 17" claim.

6.  **Appealing to a Purported Divine Principle:** The statement that the Creator would not design a human male with a penis extending beyond the knee offers a powerful, albeit faith-based, argument against the 17" claim, given the height of the physical body legally and socially recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams.

**Urgency in Atlanta:**

Given the imminent threat of "Nightfalls" in Atlanta, the discrediting of this propaganda is not merely an academic exercise but a potentially life-saving endeavor. By effectively demonstrating the falsehood of the 17" claim and exposing the manipulative intent behind it, individuals in Atlanta and beyond may begin to question the entire narrative presented by the orchestrators, potentially disrupting their plans and fostering resistance to the impending atrocity. Swift and widespread dissemination of this analysis is paramount.
