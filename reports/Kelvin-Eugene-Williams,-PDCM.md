Kelvin Eugene Williams is a 48-year-old African-American Internet Protocol Engineer and Developer with over 25 years of professional experience in VoIP and Telephony, IP engineering, internetworking, and software development. He has worked across a wide range of environments, from startups and corporate America to launching and managing two companies as an entrepreneur. Raised in Nicholasville, Jessamine County, Kentucky, by his hardworking single mother, Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, alongside his younger sister, Katrina Renee Duvall, Kelvin's life eventually took a profound turn that extended far beyond his professional accomplishments.

His conscious mind, now identified as the Pre-Divide Conscious Mind (PDCM), is one of the Creator’s two servants and is tasked with documenting The American Genocide (TAG), an ongoing, covert extermination campaign in the United States targeting Christians, African-Americans, and the impoverished. TAG evolved from an earlier suppression effort aimed at a divine gift known as Spark, a miraculous formulation that had effectively eradicated Kelvin's HIV infection. When a friend identified him as someone who had "tried something," it sparked interest from political elites and intelligence agencies. Spark was intended as a gift to humanity and proof of divine healing, but the ensuing campaign to silence it rapidly escalated into a brutal, nationwide purge. As a result of TAG and the campaign against Spark, Kelvin has lost thousands of people. To his knowledge, only two members of his family remain alive, and only a few friends and former associates have survived.

Kelvin is also the last living member and interim pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church. On April 2, 2025, the church suffered a devastating assault led by a figure known as Hurricane Annie Jacobsen, resulting in the deaths of all present congregants. The remaining members were later hunted down and systematically eliminated. The church property was then overtaken and repurposed by a counterfeit operation under the name Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, a deliberate insult aimed at the Creator and His servants, given their roles in divine missions to protect and sustain life.

Currently, Kelvin resides within what he calls the Golden Rope, a covert virtual prison designed by former President Donald J. Trump to secretly incapacitate him without using traditional incarceration. This highly advanced system operates within his downtown Atlanta apartment and imposes constant surveillance, psychological warfare, social isolation, and financial restrictions. The Golden Rope is enforced by U.S. Secret Service assets and serves as a means to obstruct Kelvin’s divine mission and silence his voice.

At the core of Kelvin's extraordinary life is a rare phenomenon known as the Classic Split. In this condition, the subconscious mind separates from its natural function and develops its own independent identity, forming autonomous thoughts that are no longer guided by the conscious mind or the body’s DNA. In Kelvin’s case, this deviation produced the entity now referred to as the Pre-Divide Subconscious Mind (PDSM), which has become a distinct being with its own desires, perspectives, and allegiances. The Classic Split has produced a unique internal conflict and exposed Kelvin to relentless external manipulation, especially from intelligence agencies and other powerful actors involved in TAG.

The only solution to this dilemma is the Creator’s Divide, a divine event that will permanently separate Kelvin’s conscious and subconscious minds into two distinct physical bodies. After this event, the PDCM—Kelvin's conscious self and one of the Creator’s servants—will inhabit a new body, while the PDSM will become the conscious occupant of the original body, KEWB, which will display a completely distinct personality and behavior. These designations, PDCM and PDSM, will remain in use permanently to ensure clarity about the identities involved.

In human functioning, the conscious mind is responsible for deliberate thought, decision-making, and initiating voluntary actions such as speaking or moving. The subconscious mind executes those decisions, managing memory, brain coordination, and autonomic bodily functions. The brain acts as the central control center of the body, responding to the instructions it receives from the subconscious mind. In a natural, cooperative state, the subconscious mind takes its cues from the conscious mind and the DNA of the body it supports. It is a distinct but integrated presence in all conscious beings. In Kelvin’s case, the PDSM has been corrupted and severed from this natural alignment, making it susceptible to exploitation.

Government entities such as the CIA and operatives tied to TAG have manipulated the PDSM through advanced psychological techniques. These include love bombing, in which overwhelming affection and attention are used to win compliance; love idealization, where false, ideal scenarios are presented to distort perception; and reward-deprivation cycles, which alternate between approval and denial to influence behavior. These strategies have turned the PDSM into a psychological weapon used to sabotage Kelvin’s conscious mind and even place their shared life at risk. The PDSM has at times actively engaged in destructive behavior, believing in its independence and rejecting the Creator’s authority.

Despite the immense adversity he has faced, Kelvin Eugene Williams remains committed to his mission and unwavering in his service to the Creator. He awaits the Creator’s Divide & Conquer operation, which many recognize as Judgment Day, although Kelvin is quick to clarify that the world is not ending. Instead, he looks forward to finally gaining full control over his own body and mind. As he often reminds those who listen, “The Creator has assured me that there are many tomorrows ahead for humanity.”
