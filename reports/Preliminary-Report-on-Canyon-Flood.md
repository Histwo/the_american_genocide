# Preliminary Report: Operation Canyon Flood

**Prepared by:** One of the Creator's Two Servants
**Date:** Saturday, May 3, 2025
**Time:** 1:31 AM EDT (Atlanta, Georgia)

This preliminary report details the meticulously orchestrated and ruthlessly executed operation known as Canyon Flood, conceived and implemented by the orchestrators of TAG (The American Genocide). This analysis will describe the operation, its constituent sub-operations, and provide an initial assessment of its strategic objectives and implications.

## Overview of Canyon Flood

Canyon Flood was a multi-stage operation centered at the masquerade Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, TN. This location, bearing the concealed history of a previous TAG-orchestrated congregation massacre, was cynically utilized to project an image of normalcy and security, serving as a lure for unsuspecting victims. The overarching goal of Canyon Flood was to significantly advance the orchestrators' authoritarian agenda by eliminating targeted populations (the impoverished and political opposition) while ensuring absolute operational secrecy through the elimination of the perpetrators involved. The operation unfolded rapidly in the days leading up to and including May 2, 2025, prior to the full manifestation of the Creator's intervention.

The name "Canyon Flood," divinely inspired and revealed to one of the Creator's servants through the lyrics of "A Mighty Leviathan of Old" by Vandaveer ("And the canyon did flood with water and blood"), poignantly symbolizes the intended devastation within the Tennessee Valley: the "water" representing the mass elimination of the impoverished, and the "blood" representing the targeted assassinations of political opposition.

## Sub-Operations of Canyon Flood

Canyon Flood comprised three key sub-operations:

### 1. The Phantom Pantry Operations

* **Timeline:** April 28, 2025 - May 1, 2025
* **Location:** Masquerade Hickory Valley Christian Church, Chattanooga, TN
* **Target:** Impoverished individuals from the Tennessee Valley region.
* **Description:** A series of deceptive events, advertised as charitable food distribution ("Phantom Pantries"), were staged at the masquerade church. These events lured vulnerable individuals with the promise of aid, only for them to be systematically executed by a team of 60 perpetrators recruited from southwest Atlanta.
* **Analysis:** This sub-operation served the strategic objective of eliminating a segment of the population deemed "undesirable" by the orchestrators of TAG, aligning with their broader demographic reshaping agenda. The exploitation of a church setting, intended to inspire trust, underscores the profound cynicism of the orchestrators.

### 2. The Phantom Funeral Operation

* **Timeline:** May 2, 2025 (11:00 AM - 2:00 PM EDT)
* **Location:** Masquerade Hickory Valley Christian Church, Chattanooga, TN
* **Target:** Political opponents of the orchestrators of TAG and individuals likely to resist their authoritarian regime.
* **Description:** A deceptive funeral service ("Phantom Funeral") was staged at the masquerade church. This event lured targeted individuals under the guise of mourning and community solidarity. Upon arrival, the same 60 perpetrators responsible for the Phantom Pantry massacres executed these individuals.
* **Analysis:** This sub-operation directly addressed the strategic objective of neutralizing opposition to the orchestrators' consolidation of power. The use of a funeral, a traditionally somber and respectful occasion, as a means of mass assassination reveals the utter ruthlessness of the orchestrators.

### 3. Perpetrator Management

* **Timeline:** Execution immediately following the Phantom Funeral on May 2, 2025.
* **Location:** Hickory Valley Christian Church, Chattanooga, TN
* **Target:** The 60 perpetrators recruited from southwest Atlanta.
* **Description:** To ensure absolute operational secrecy and prevent any future exposure of their involvement in Canyon Flood, the orchestrators planned and executed the elimination of the 60 perpetrators at Hickory Valley Christian Church immediately after the completion of the Phantom Funeral. This represents a deviation from previous operations at this site, which utilized and then eliminated sentenced inmates. The orchestrators deemed these new perpetrators untrustworthy and the risk of them revealing information too high.
* **Analysis:** This sub-operation was critical for maintaining the clandestine nature of Canyon Flood. The elimination of the perpetrators at the operational site, while carrying its own risks, demonstrates the orchestrators' commitment to preventing any leaks. Furthermore, their deaths in Chattanooga were strategically intended to be obscured by being counted amongst the casualties and disappearances resulting from the subsequent Operation Nightfalls in Atlanta, providing a layer of plausible deniability.

## Overarching Analysis of Canyon Flood

Canyon Flood represents a significant step in the orchestrators of TAG's campaign to establish an authoritarian state. The operation successfully eliminated a substantial number of individuals deemed undesirable and neutralized potential opposition, all while leveraging the deceptive facade of a community church with a hidden history of violence.

The strategic choice of perpetrators from southwest Atlanta, the target of Operation Nightfalls, highlights the intricate and interconnected nature of the orchestrators' plans. The elimination of these perpetrators immediately after their involvement in Canyon Flood, with their deaths to be masked by the chaos of Nightfalls, underscores the orchestrators' meticulous planning and their determination to operate with impunity.

The divinely inspired name, "Canyon Flood," serves as a stark reminder of the immense loss of life and the catastrophic nature of this operation, a literal flooding of the Tennessee Valley with the "water" of the impoverished and the "blood" of the resistant. This preliminary report serves as a testament to the horrific reality unfolding under the orchestrators of TAG.
