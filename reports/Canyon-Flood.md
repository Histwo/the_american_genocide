## Canyon Flood: Preliminary Report

**Canyon Flood** represents a meticulously planned and ruthlessly executed initiative orchestrated by the **orchestrators of TAG** to significantly advance their vision for an authoritarian state and consolidating their authoritarian regime. This operation, centered entirely at the **masquerade Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, TN**, unfolds through a series of deceptive sub-operations designed to eliminate key target groups while ensuring the long-term secrecy of their actions. The choice of Hickory Valley Christian Church as the operational hub is deliberate and multifaceted. Following the covert May 12, 2024 massacre of its original congregation (an atrocity orchestrated by TAG but **not public knowledge**) and subsequent **secret operations to eliminate any remaining affiliates**, the orchestrators established a "masquerade church" entity. This serves to **conceal the previous atrocities and project an image of normalcy** within the surrounding community, preempting any suspicion or investigation into the church's sudden change in personnel and activities. This manufactured normalcy, along with the inherent sense of security some may associate with a church, is a deliberate tactic to lure victims into a deadly trap. Notably, the perpetrators utilized in Canyon Flood represent a deviation from the orchestrators' typical modus operandi at this location. Previous **unpublicized** operations at Hickory Valley Christian Church have predominantly employed sentenced inmates from the state of Georgia, who were deceptively promised sentence reductions for assisting with a purported National Security problem, only to be eliminated after their involvement. The shift to using individuals recruited from southwest Atlanta for Canyon Flood suggests a strategic adaptation, likely tied to the planned elimination of these perpetrators in the subsequent Operation Nightfalls in Atlanta. All actions within Canyon Flood are undertaken with an acute awareness of the impending intervention by the Creator, driving the orchestrators' urgency to achieve their objectives.

**The name "Canyon Flood" for this overarching operation was divinely inspired and selected by one of the Creator's two servants, drawing from the lyrics of "A Mighty Leviathan of Old" by Vandaveer: "And the canyon did flood with water and blood." In this context:**

* **"the canyon did flood"** refers to the Tennessee Valley region, the geographical area targeted by the operation.
* **"water"** symbolizes the victims of the Phantom Pantry sub-operations – the impoverished individuals lured by the promise of aid.
* **"blood"** symbolizes the victims of the Phantom Funeral sub-operation – the political opponents and resistors targeted for assassination.

This divinely inspired name encapsulates the scale and tragic nature of the operation, highlighting the intended widespread elimination of life within the Tennessee Valley.

### I. The Strategic Objective

The primary strategic objective of Canyon Flood is twofold:

* **Elimination of Undesirables:** To systematically reduce the population deemed undesirable by the orchestrators, specifically targeting the impoverished within the Tennessee Valley region through the "Phantom Pantry" sub-operations. This aligns with their broader vision for a restructured society.
* **Neutralization of Opposition:** To decisively neutralize individuals and groups identified as political opponents and potential resistors to the establishment of their authoritarian regime through the "Phantom Funeral" sub-operation.

Crucially, the operation also prioritizes the maintenance of absolute operational secrecy through the planned and silent elimination of the individuals directly carrying out the killings. The change in perpetrator sourcing for this operation underscores this priority, especially given the need to maintain the secrecy of the earlier massacre.

### II. The Operational Site

The entirety of Canyon Flood is strategically located at **Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, TN**. The establishment of the "masquerade church" is key to the orchestrators' plan to maintain control over the narrative and prevent public awareness of the site's sinister history.

### III. The Sub-Operations

* **A. Sub-Operation: The Phantom Pantry Massacres**
    * During the week leading up to May 2, 2025, the masquerade Hickory Valley Christian Church hosted a series of events deceptively advertised as charitable food distribution ("Phantom Pantries"). These events targeted impoverished individuals from the Tennessee Valley, luring them with the promise of essential aid at a seemingly legitimate and familiar location. Once a sufficient number of individuals were gathered, the **60 perpetrators recruited from southwest Atlanta** carried out their systematic elimination. These perpetrators were incentivized with the personal belongings and meager possessions of their victims.
* **B. Sub-Operation: The Phantom Funeral Massacre**
    * On Friday, May 2, 2025, between 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM EDT, the masquerade Hickory Valley Christian Church hosted a "Phantom Funeral." This event was a carefully constructed trap designed to lure political opponents of the orchestrators and individuals known to resist their authoritarian agenda. These targets, often of higher social standing and potential influence, were drawn to the church under the guise of a religious ceremony at a location that, due to the masquerade, appeared to be a functioning community institution. Upon their arrival, the **same 60 perpetrators from southwest Atlanta** responsible for the Phantom Pantry massacres carried out their assassinations, further incentivized by the cash, vehicles, and electronics of these higher-value targets.
* **C. Sub-Operation: Perpetrator Management**
    * To ensure complete operational secrecy and eliminate any potential for future exposure, the orchestrators implemented a crucial "Perpetrator Management" sub-operation. For the execution of both the Phantom Pantry and Phantom Funeral massacres, they recruited a specific group of **60 individuals from southwest Atlanta**, a departure from their previous reliance on sentenced inmates in **unpublicized** operations at this site. These individuals were incentivized with material gains (belongings, cash, vehicles) taken from the victims. Crucially, these perpetrators were chosen because they reside within the target zone of the upcoming Operation Nightfalls in Atlanta and are unknowingly intended to be eliminated during that event. This strategic shift in perpetrator sourcing directly links Canyon Flood to Nightfalls.
    * **Strategic Significance of the Deviation:** The move away from using sentenced inmates, a practice employed in previous **secret** operations at Hickory Valley, suggests a specific need to have perpetrators who can be credibly placed within the narrative of Operation Nightfalls. Using individuals from southwest Atlanta, the target of the false flag, ensures their deaths align with the fabricated story and further obscures any connection to the events in Chattanooga and the orchestrators' past activities at the church.

### IV. The Temporal Context

Canyon Flood was executed with a clear awareness of the impending divine intervention, referred to as "Divide & Conquer," which the orchestrators anticipate will disrupt their broader agenda. This urgency fueled the rapid and brutal execution of both sub-operations.

### V. The Critical Link: The 60 Perpetrators and Operation Nightfalls

The 60 perpetrators from southwest Atlanta serve as the linchpin connecting the atrocities in Chattanooga to the planned false flag event in Atlanta. Their recruitment, utilization in both sub-operations of Canyon Flood, and their intended elimination in Nightfalls underscore the orchestrators' comprehensive and ruthless strategy. This ensures not only the immediate elimination of targeted groups but also the complete erasure of the human element that could potentially expose their crimes in the future. The exploitation of a site already marked by TAG's violence, now concealed under a facade of normalcy, coupled with the strategic choice of perpetrators, adds a further layer of depravity to their plan.
