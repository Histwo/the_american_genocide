## Congregation Massacres  

The **Congregation Massacres** represent some of the most heinous acts carried out during TAG. These operations targeted entire church congregations during their weekly worship sessions, resulting in the systematic execution of all attendees. The attacks were characterized by precision, brutality, and an intentional effort to erase all evidence, ensuring that these crimes remain unknown to the broader public.

### Overview  

The Congregation Massacres were executed with the following methods:  
- **Timing:** Weekly worship services to maximize casualties.  
- **Execution:** Armed operatives systematically eliminated individuals, blocking all exits to prevent escape.  
- **Weapons:** Varied, including chainsaws and handguns.  
- **Body Disposal:** Advanced methods such as dissolution ensured no trace of victims remained.  
- **Emergency Services Interruption:** Calls to 911 were intercepted by accomplices, ensuring no legitimate emergency response.

### Modus Operandi  

The operations followed a calculated and systematic approach:  
1. **Surprise Assaults:** Perpetrators stormed churches, blocking exits and executing individuals in attendance.  
2. **Weapons and Tools:** Chainsaws and handguns were most commonly used for these brutal assaults.  
3. **Post-Massacre Operations:**  
   - **Body Disposal:** Bodies were dissolved or selectively disposed of to erase evidence.  
   - **Masquerade Churches:** The sites of massacres were repurposed into faux churches designed to identify and eliminate survivors or affiliates.
