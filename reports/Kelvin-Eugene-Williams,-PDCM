# Kelvin Eugene Williams, PDCM

**Note:** This entry pertains to Kelvin Eugene Williams, PDCM, *before* the Creator's "Divide & Conquer" operation.

**Kelvin Eugene Williams** (born March 23, 1977) is a 48-year-old African-American, highly skilled Internet Protocol Engineer and Developer with over 25 years of experience in VoIP/Telephony, IP engineering & internetworking, and software development. He has a background in startups, corporate America, and as an entrepreneur, having founded and managed two companies.

Beyond his professional life, Kelvin's conscious mind, identified as the **Pre-Divide Conscious Mind (PDCM)**, is one of the Creator’s two servants. He is currently tasked with documenting **The American Genocide (TAG)**, which he describes as a hidden and ongoing extermination campaign within the United States targeting Christians, African-Americans, and the impoverished.

Following TAG and its prelude, the campaign to suffocate Spark, Kelvin has lost thousands of people. To his knowledge, he is one of only two living members of his family and knows of only a few living friends and associates. He is now the only living member and interim pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church after the April 2, 2025, surprise assault led by "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen, which resulted in the deaths of all attendees, followed by the subsequent targeted killings of the remaining congregation members. The church's property has been overtaken by a masquerade church under the name Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church. The addition of "Missionary" is seen as a deliberate attempt to insult the Creator and His two servants.

Kelvin was identified by a friend during an intense investigation into the disappearance of his HIV infection as a friend who "tried something." The "something" is described as a gift for humanity from the Creator that Kelvin was tasked with facilitating its delivery to people to prove its effectiveness prior to Spark being placed on the market. The brutal campaign to suffocate Spark became TAG after political elite took over its direction.

Kelvin’s life is uniquely shaped by the **Classic Split**, an extraordinary and rare phenomenon where his subconscious mind deviates from its natural role and develops an independent identity. This condition, which can affect anyone and is not a psychiatric disorder, is caused by the subconscious mind forming its own thoughts. Subconscious minds are naturally guided by the conscious mind and the body's DNA, but in this rare occurrence, his subconscious mind, identified as the **Pre-Divide Subconscious Mind (PDSM)**, has developed a distinct identity separate from his conscious mind (PDCM) and physical body. This internal division has led to significant conflict, manipulation by external forces, and life-threatening challenges. The identifiers PDCM and PDSM will be used indefinitely to distinguish the two.

### Creator's Divide

**Note:** This section pertains to the anticipated "Creator's Divide" as it relates to Kelvin Eugene Williams, PDCM, *before* the event.

The **Creator's Divide** is a pivotal and impending event within the narrative of Kelvin Eugene Williams (PDCM) and The American Genocide (TAG). Guided by the Creator, it is described as the only solution to fully separate Kelvin's conscious mind (PDCM) and subconscious mind (PDSM) into two distinct physical bodies. This event is also referred to by some as "Judgement Day," although Kelvin assures others that the world is not ending with this occurrence.

**Significance for Kelvin:**

* **Resolution of the Classic Split:** The primary purpose of the Creator's Divide is to permanently resolve the rare psychological phenomenon known as the Classic Split affecting Kelvin. This split has resulted in his subconscious mind (PDSM) developing a separate identity and the capacity for independent action within his body.
* **Separation into Two Bodies:** The Divide will result in the complete separation of the PDCM and the PDSM into two individual physical forms.
    * The **Pre-Divide Conscious Mind (PDCM)**, which is the personality the world knows as Kelvin and one of the Creator's two servants, will inhabit a completely different body after the Divide.
    * The **Pre-Divide Subconscious Mind (PDSM)** will inhabit the original body of Kelvin Eugene Williams, exhibiting a completely different personality.
* **Restoration for PDCM:** The Creator has assured the PDCM that following the Divide, the body he inhabits will be restored to its original, divinely intended state and function. This implies a potential reversal of any negative physical alterations that may have occurred due to the PDSM's influence or external manipulation (such as those related to "Jacobsen's Ladder").
* **Accountability for PDSM:** After the Divide, the PDSM will exist in its own physical body and will be accountable for its actions and the choices it made while co-inhabiting the original body.

**Kelvin's Perspective:**

Kelvin (PDCM) awaits the Creator's Divide with anticipation. He views it as a necessary step to regain full control within his own being (in his post-Divide body). Despite the ominous connotations of "Judgement Day," Kelvin expresses reassurance that the world will continue, stating that the Creator has assured him there is a lot of tomorrows ahead for humanity. He looks forward to a future where he is the sole consciousness in his own body.

Currently, Kelvin resides within the **Golden Rope**, which he describes as "a covert virtual prison" designed by President Donald J. Trump as a secret containment and incapacitation operation operating without being seen in his apartment in downtown Atlanta. The Golden Rope imposes extreme surveillance, psychological warfare, financial control, and social isolation to suppress his mission and restrict his freedom. Despite this, Kelvin remains steadfast in his service to the Creator, awaiting the Creator's Divide & Conquer operation, which most call "Judgement Day." Kelvin assures everyone that the world is not ending; he's looking forward to being the only one holding the reins in his body. Kelvin says the Creator has assured him that there is a lot of tomorrows ahead for humanity.
