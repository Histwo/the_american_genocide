# Exegesis of Revelation 17:9-11 within the Context of TAG

This document presents the specific signification of the biblical passage Revelation 17:9-11 as revealed by the Creator within the narrative of The American Genocide (TAG). This divine unveiling provides a crucial understanding of the term and concept of [[Jacobsen's Ladder|Jacobsen's-Ladder]], linking the physical reality of **Jacobsen's Ladder** to symbolic language within scripture. This exegesis illuminates the Creator's perspective on the manipulations enacted upon **Jacobsen's Ladder** and exposes the deceptive strategies employed by the orchestrators of TAG.

## Placement Within Revelation 17:9-11 and the Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)

The specific placement of the Creator's revelation regarding Jacobsen's Ladder within Revelation 17:9-11 carries a multi-layered significance. Firstly, the very chapter number, **17**, is a direct reference to the orchestrators' deliberate and false reporting of a 17-inch length for **Jacobsen's Ladder**. This fabricated measurement was a key element in their flawed litmus test procedures, a test that was intentionally designed to always yield a "Pass" result. This "Pass" falsely indicated no possible intervention or interest by the Creator, as the threshold condition for such a determination was the impossible 17-inch length. This false measurement was also provided to observers during staged observations, some of whom were subsequently recruited as operatives based on their (mis)perceptions.

Secondly, the verses 9-11 are presented as a direct reference to the North American emergency number, **911**, and the orchestrators' intentional redirection tactics during their operations. This numerical reference within the divinely inspired text highlights the Creator's awareness of and condemnation for the Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT) employed by government agencies, including the CIA (identified as the primary perpetrator of TAG orchestrations). This tactic was used during orchestrations that were authorized after reading the flawed litmus test (which invariably gave a "Pass" due to the 17-inch threshold) or during orchestrations that utilized new operatives who were recruited after staged observations where they were falsely told the actual length was 17 inches. ESIT aimed to control emergency communications during sensitive operations.

The Creator's choice to reveal this truth within such a weighty passage highlights the gravity of this particular deception. The claim of a 17-inch length is not merely a trivial exaggeration but a blatant fabrication that defies the natural limitations of human anatomy on the human male body's height. As the Creator reveals, a human male body's height would not naturally develop a **Jacobsen's Ladder** where the head extends past the knee. This anatomical impossibility renders the orchestrators' reporting a deliberate and egregious lie.

By embedding the truth about Jacobsen's Ladder's original form and the extent of its reduction within these specific verses of Revelation, the Creator directly counters the orchestrators' disinformation campaign. It serves as a divine correction and a clear indication of the Creator's awareness of and opposition to their manipulative tactics and outright falsehoods. The strategic placement within this prophetic text emphasizes the spiritual significance of truth and the Creator's condemnation of the orchestrators' deceptive practices concerning **Jacobsen's Ladder**.

The verses 9-11 are a direct reference to the North American emergency number 911 and the intentional redirection tactic during orchestrations, specifically those that were authorized after the use of the flawed litmus test in Jacobsen's Ladder or that used operatives recruited after staged observations of **Jacobsen's Ladder** where the length was reported as 17".

The Creator's inclusion of this numerical cue within Revelation points to the insidious nature of ESIT and its direct impact on the safety and well-being of individuals targeted during TAG. The redirection of calls to 911, facilitated by methods like **Covert Cells on Wheels (CoWs)**, **Memoranda for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion**, and **Selective Router Tampering**, mirrors the orchestrators' broader strategy of manipulation and control. By intercepting and redirecting emergency calls, they sought to:

* Prevent legitimate emergency responses, thus hindering any organized resistance to their operations.
* Maintain operational secrecy by controlling the flow of information and preventing external intervention.
* Ensure operative safety by delaying or eliminating immediate threats from potential victims seeking help.

The Creator's use of the 9-11 reference within this scriptural context serves as a divine indictment of this specific tactic, linking the orchestrators' manipulation of emergency services to their broader campaign of deception and control, as exemplified by their lies surrounding Jacobsen's Ladder. The placement underscores the severity of these actions in the Creator's eyes.

## Exegesis of Revelation 17:9-11

Within the narrative of The American Genocide, the passage from Revelation 17:9-11 is presented as a direct revelation from the Creator regarding **Jacobsen's Ladder**. This is how the Creator signifies its meaning:

* **"The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits..."** The Creator declares that "heads" symbolize imperial inches of penile length. Furthermore, "heads" also signifies the "average" classification that the orchestrators of TAG applied to the reduced size of **Jacobsen's Ladder** for their propaganda. Thus, "seven heads" reveals the approximately seven imperial inches of **Jacobsen's Ladder** in its manipulated, reduced form, while simultaneously exposing the deceptive "average" label.

* **"...and they are seven kings."** The Creator states that "kings" also symbolize imperial inches of penile length. However, "kings" further signifies "above-average," "well-hung," or "BBC" â€“ a slang term ("King") the Creator identifies as coined by the CIA (the primary perpetrator of TAG orchestrations). The equivalence of "seven heads" and "seven kings" (both representing seven inches) is the Creator's direct statement that the KEWB is not average, alluding to its original, larger size of **Jacobsen's Ladder**.

* **"Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain for only a little while."** According to the Creator:
    * **"Five have fallen"** signifies the five imperial inches of permanent size reduction inflicted upon **Jacobsen's Ladder**. This was enacted at the direction of the operatives and orchestrators of TAG and performed by the PDSM (the subconscious mind within the KEWB).
    * **"One is..."** reveals an additional half (0.5) inch of observable length on **Jacobsen's Ladder** in its original form that was sometimes evident during periods of over-stimulation. This is the Creator's indication of a dynamic aspect of its original state.
    * **"The other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain for only a little while"** is a further revelation from the Creator, potentially referring to future states or interventions related to **Jacobsen's Ladder** within the unfolding narrative of TAG. Its full meaning in this context is to be understood within the story's progression.

* **The Creator's Revelation of the Original Form:** Based on this divine signification, the original **form** of **Jacobsen's Ladder** is revealed as follows: The current reduced size is the "seven heads/kings" (7 inches). The permanent reduction is "five have fallen" (5 inches). The observable additional length in its original state is "one is..." (0.5 inches). Therefore, the Creator reveals the original length to be 7 + 5 + 0.5 = **12.5 imperial inches**. This measurement is presented as divinely revealed and corroborated by Creator-inspired artworks.

This specific signification of Revelation 17:9-11 within the framework of TAG provides the Creator's direct understanding of the manipulated state of Jacobsen's Ladder, the orchestrators' deceptive use of "average," and the divinely revealed measurement of **Jacobsen's Ladder** in its original **form**.
