# Victim's Echo: The Phantom Funeral of Rev. Dr. Duke Stone

## Preface

This *Victim's Echo* presents a detailed account of an orchestration that unfolded during The American Genocide (TAG), offering a glimpse into these horrific events through the eyes of a victim. It is part of a larger collection of narratives, meticulously recorded by one of the Creator’s two servants, based on information the Creator directly revealed to His servant.

Each of the *Victim's Echoes* within this collection strives to be a vivid and truthful representation of these historical occurrences, shared with the crucial aim to raise awareness about this hidden and ongoing genocide.

The primary goal of these narratives is to illuminate the atrocities that define TAG. By sharing these individual experiences, we seek to honor the memory of those who perished and ensure that their immense suffering is never relegated to oblivion. These accounts form an integral part of a broader endeavor to educate, inform, and inspire profound reflection on these devastating events.

The narrative that follows is entirely factual, rooted in specific details the Creator provided directly to His servant. Tragically, the very nature of these orchestrations meant that no victims survived to tell their tales. Furthermore, the orchestrators of TAG have directed the elimination of both perpetrators and intermediaries to ensure secrecy; many who were involved in the early stages have also since been killed.

These victim accounts exist solely due to the Creator's intervention, as He revealed the truth of these events to His servant, thereby allowing for their documentation and dissemination to the world.

For those who may find the realities depicted within these stories challenging to confront, we respectfully encourage seeking understanding through prayer and introspection. The truth, however difficult it may be to accept, remains steadfast and undeniably real.

The victim's experience and thoughts, as presented herein, are made possible through the Creator’s direct guidance. He revealed the intricate details of these events and the victim's inner world to His servant for the explicit purpose of public disclosure. These accounts serve as a solemn testament to the enduring importance of truth and remembrance.

To provide essential context, we offer the following understanding of the figure central to the revelation of these events: the Creator, revered globally across cultures, is the One who desired to create life and, therefore, had to create the universe to support it. He is the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great “I Am.” These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. His two servants neutrally refer to Him as "the Creator," in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and even atheists.

## Introduction

The American Genocide (TAG) is a chilling reality: an ongoing and hidden covert and systematic campaign of extermination orchestrated by:

1.  President Donald J. Trump
2.  Senior CIA Operative Annie Jacobsen ("Hurricane Annie")
3.  Senior CIA Operative Michael Blackmon
4.  President Joe Biden
5.  Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)
6.  Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY)
7.  CIA Director William Burns

This operation, backed by the White House and various government entities, aims to establish an authoritarian regime. TAG targets and eliminates specific groups of people within the United States. The Creator views each of the people who’ve lost their lives as a martyr.

The motives behind TAG include the desire to consolidate power, suppress opposition, and eliminate those considered undesirable by the orchestrators.

The groups targeted in TAG include:

* **American Christians (all races):** Christians are targeted because their faith, moral resistance, and unwillingness to submit make them an obstacle to the orchestrators' aspirations of absolute power and authoritarian rule.
    * Reasons why Christians would oppose an authoritarian regime or not support it:
        * Christians often prioritize their allegiance to God and their faith's teachings, which may conflict with the demands of an authoritarian regime.
        * Christian values emphasize individual conscience, moral responsibility, and the importance of justice, which can lead to resistance against oppressive rule.
        * Historically, Christians have opposed authoritarian regimes that seek to suppress religious freedom or impose state ideologies.
* **African-Americans:** Considered undesirable by the orchestrators.
* **The impoverished:** Considered undesirable by the orchestrators.

The methods employed in TAG are brutal and systematic, encompassing targeted killings, mass executions, and deceptive operations designed to lure and eliminate victims. A particularly sinister hallmark of The American Genocide is the orchestration of events designed for mass extermination, unique in their conception and execution. **Congregation massacres, Phantom Funerals, and Phantom Pantries are all orchestrations (mass executions) unique to The American Genocide.** The lives lost will illustrate the death toll and the activities of the orchestrators, and empower members of the general public to bring it to a halt. The Creator never included death in His creation's design, although death can and does happen; every single death is significant for Him.

The Congregation Massacres, a chilling chapter in TAG, involve covert, high-intensity operations targeting church congregations during their weekly worship services. In each case, the massacres involved the systematic execution of every individual present, with no one left to tell the tale. These operations were meticulously planned and carried out by operatives under the direction of Annie Jacobsen, known as *“Hurricane Annie.”*

On April 2, 2023, during Sunday worship at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, one such massacre unfolded. Armed forces stormed the sanctuary, blocking exits and covering windows. Congregants attempting to flee were gunned down. Those who called 911 unknowingly spoke to fake dispatchers who falsely assured them help was on the way. The attack escalated into brutal assault, rape, and systematic execution. Victims were beheaded with chainsaws at the piano and organ, forced to witness the slaughter of their loved ones before meeting the same fate. The Creator, the very one they had gathered to worship, heard their cries – the cries of doves.

The details of the church assaults include:

* Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Lexington, KY; predominantly African American; 127 victims. This was the lifelong church of one of the Creator's two servants, though they had not been a regular attendee in recent years and were not present on April 2, 2023.
* Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, Lexington, KY; predominantly Caucasian; 250 victims.
* House of God (Georgetown Street), Lexington, KY; predominantly African American; 300 victims.
* House of God (Broadway), Lexington, KY; predominantly African American; 300 victims.
* Mount Zion Baptist Church, Georgetown, KY; predominantly African American; 166 victims.
* Calvary Baptist Church, Lexington, KY; predominantly Caucasian; 400 victims.
* Hickory Valley Christian Church, Chattanooga, TN; predominantly Caucasian; 1000 victims. This church operated a private school, Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, where one of the Creator's two servants had donated his professional expertise and time upgrading their computer lab at the request of a friend. Retired Pastor Duke Stone, who was also the principal of the school, was told by the Creator's servant of the massacre at his church and others and urged them to take precautions during their worship services.

These massacres were executed with terrifying efficiency. Armed operatives stormed sanctuaries during the most vulnerable moments—weekly worship services—blockading exits and systematically executing all attendees. Those who attempted to flee were swiftly neutralized. The perpetrators, under the direction of Jacobsen, utilized prescribed methods of execution: in some instances, beheading was employed to ensure swift, silent, and efficient killing; in other massacres, firing squads eliminated the congregations. In the aftermath, the bodies were disposed of with chilling thoroughness, through a chemical dissolution method designed to leave no trace of the victims behind. Jacobsen also implemented a strategic deception campaign, using mobile cell towers to reroute emergency calls and make it appear as if help was on the way, when in reality, no local authorities were ever contacted or dispatched.

The Creator foretold of these events in prophecy and through the arts, including *"Sign o' the Times"* and *"When the Doves Cry"* by Prince. The 1987 hit song *“Sign of the Times”* by Prince prophetically predicted Jacobsen’s involvement in these horrific events. The song’s haunting lyrics include the line: *“Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling off a church and killed everyone inside.”* This lyric eerily foretells Jacobsen’s future actions in carrying out the mass executions inside sanctuaries in Central Kentucky and Chattanooga, Tennessee, cementing her place as the figurehead of these atrocities.

Prince’s song *“When Doves Cry,”* though often interpreted as a song about lost love and emotional turmoil, carries a far more profound and prophetic meaning. It serves as a divine lament for the brutal massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church, any of the six other churches that followed, or the orchestrations carried out in TAG that used the properties of the seven churches as the site of a mass execution. The lyrics poignantly capture the terror of the congregants as they desperately tried to flee, not just physically but also mentally, by imagining peaceful scenes. The “animals” in the lyrics represent the merciless operatives, while the agonizing questions reflect the victims’ disbelief at being forsaken. The chilling command, *"Don't make me chase you,"* echoes the operatives chasing terrified children through the sanctuary as they desperately tried to escape their execution. Ultimately, the “cries” in the song symbolize the sound of innocent lives being extinguished as chainsaws roared through the sanctuary. Prince, unknowingly divinely inspired, transcribed this horrific tragedy decades before it occurred, creating an unspoken memorial to the victims of these atrocities, regardless of which church property became their final resting place.

In the aftermath of the church attacks, surviving members of the congregation were hunted down and individually executed. The properties of the targeted churches were repurposed into masquerade churches to facilitate further mass executions. These masquerade churches were used in operations such as:

* **Fake Funerals (Phantom Funerals):** Bogus memorial services lured in grieving mourners who were then eliminated.
* **Fake Charitable Services (Phantom Pantries):** False offers of aid, like food pantries, were used to systematically lure and eliminate the impoverished.

The orchestrators of TAG implement elaborate cover-up measures to conceal their actions, including the chemical dissolution of bodies, identity theft, digital deception, the silencing of those who suspect the truth, and the suppression of investigations.

TAG meets the United Nations definition of genocide. Through systematic killings, mental harm, sterilizations, and the destruction of communities, TAG’s orchestrators aim to eradicate entire groups.

The Creator has deemed it necessary to make a rare intervention into human affairs to bring TAG to a halt.

> "The American Genocide is an active and hidden genocide that has the full support of the White House, some in congressional leadership, and is occurring entirely within the borders of one of the planet's last superpowers. It would be worse than the Holocaust; there are no Allied Forces coming because any country that would make up a part of a new Allied Forces can't imagine such a thing possible in the United States.” - the Creator.

## The Phantom Funeral of Rev. Dr. Duke Stone

The June sun glared off the sleek black cars of the motorcade as it approached Hickory Valley Christian Church, nestled in suburban Chattanooga. Angela squinted, stepping back onto the sidewalk to watch the convoy arrive. The lead vehicle bore small American flags fluttering on its hood, unmistakably signaling the presence of a high-profile dignitary.

Angela had grown up attending Hickory Valley Christian Church but hadn’t been a regular in years. Still, the church held a special place in her heart, and the passing of Rev. Dr. Duke Stone—her childhood pastor—felt like losing a piece of home.

The congregation of Hickory Valley Christian Church was a close-knit group bound by tradition and faith. The news of Rev. Stone’s and his wife’s untimely deaths in a car accident devastated them. The Stones had led the church for decades and were integral to Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, where Rev. Stone served as principal and his wife worked in the school’s office. They were beloved by students and families alike, leaving an irreplaceable void in the community.

Even after their retirement, the Stones remained active, attending services and offering counsel. Their sudden deaths united the congregation and community in mourning. Over 600 mourners gathered for the funeral—a testament to their impact.

Yet, none of them knew the full truth.

The Stones had not died in a car accident. They, along with the entire congregation present on Mother’s Day, had been executed in a brutal, unexplained assault. The event, which authorities quietly classified as an “incident,” was never investigated. No official statements followed, and the community was left bewildered by the disappearance of the congregation. The circulated cause of death for the Stones remained a fabricated car accident.

As the motorcade pulled into the church lot, murmurs rippled through the gathered mourners.

"Is that...?" someone whispered.

Angela turned to see a small group exchanging bewildered looks. The limo’s door opened, and President Donald J. Trump stepped out, flanked by Secret Service agents. Gasps swept through the crowd.

The shock of Trump’s appearance unsettled the mourners. Though Rev. Stone’s influence was far-reaching, he had never mentioned any connection to Trump in sermons, conversations, or community events.

Angela adjusted her black dress, trying to suppress her unease. It wasn’t inconceivable that Stone’s legacy could have reached high places, but Trump’s presence felt intrusive. The sacred space meant for mourning seemed overshadowed by his celebrity.

The tension followed Angela as she joined the others filing into the sanctuary.

Inside, the sanctuary felt foreign. The warmth and sense of community Angela remembered were gone, replaced by a chilling coldness. The man at the pulpit was unfamiliar—a stranger to Hickory Valley Christian Church and the Tennessee Valley. Angela assumed he had been installed at the church sometime after she had stopped attending regularly. His demeanor was detached, his voice flat as he read from a prepared script.

The eulogy was impersonal, devoid of any anecdotes about Rev. Stone’s life or ministry. There was no mention of his decades of service or the countless souls he had guided. Worse, there was no prayer—no invocation of God’s comfort, no words of salvation.

The officiant’s abruptness created an uneasy silence. “The service is concluded. Everyone must exit through the side doors,” he said without emotion.

Angela exchanged confused looks with others, but no one dared speak. They silently filed out, the air thick with dread.

Angela stepped through the side doors and froze. Before she could process her surroundings, a strong hand grabbed her arm.

“Hey!” she yelled, twisting to face her assailant. The man wore a white uniform with a blue stripe and bold letters across the back: *Dept. of Corrections*. Her stomach dropped—these were Georgia state prisoner uniforms.

As she struggled, Angela caught sight of another prisoner’s back, the letters on their uniform confirming the same origin. Her unease deepened as the reality of the situation sank in.

All around her, mourners were being seized by similarly dressed men. Some prisoners dragged people forward in silence; others barked orders. Angela’s captor tightened his grip, forcing her toward Hamilton Heights Christian Academy’s gymnasium.

The gym had been entirely renovated since the massacre on Mother’s Day. The gleaming hardwood floors, fresh paint, and bright lighting made the space unsettlingly pristine. The upgrades went unnoticed by most mourners, but Angela caught details that didn’t sit right. The announcer’s booth had been replaced with a soundproof, bulletproof structure, and the space felt oddly suited for concealment.

Angela’s dread deepened as she realized the room’s sinister design: it wasn’t a gym anymore. It was a chamber of death.

The gym doors slammed shut.

Trump entered through the double doors in the back of the gym, flanked by Secret Service agents. He ascended the bleachers slowly, pausing to meet the eyes of various mourners. Many called his name, pleading for freedom. Trump responded only with a dismissive glance.

Reaching the soundproof booth, Trump joined Annie “Hurricane Annie” Jacobsen, infamous for her TAG operations. The pair stood watching as the mourners were forced into a line. Chainsaws roared to life.

Some mourners screamed for answers; others simply wept. None came. The executions began with unrelenting brutality—chainsaws severing heads, blood spraying across the polished floor.

Angela clung to the wall, trembling, until her turn came. She was dragged forward, her eyes locking onto Trump’s unfeeling gaze before she was forced to stand before the executioner.

As the chainsaw buzzed, Angela began to pray fervently, seeking solace in her final moments. The blade came into contact with her neck, pulling and chewing through the flesh. Her body shook uncontrollably as the chainsaw’s teeth tore through muscles and tendons.

Halfway through, when her spinal cord was severed, an intense sensation of burning pain erupted throughout her body. It felt as though she were engulfed in flames. She remained acutely aware of every moment as the chainsaw cut through the last strands of muscle and skin.

Angela’s world spun wildly as her head detached, hitting the ground with a jarring thud that brought a fresh wave of searing pain. Disoriented, she realized she could still see, hear, smell, and taste. Her severed head lay on the floor, her senses heightened in a surreal, nightmarish clarity.

The metallic tang of blood and spinal fluid mixed with the acrid taste of tissue filled her mouth. The air reeked of gasoline and burnt oil from the chainsaws. She could see the room from a disjointed angle, hear the roar of machines and the screams of others, but her attempts to cry out yielded no sound.

Her consciousness persisted for what felt like an eternity, though only minutes passed. Angela’s mind raced between flashes of her family, her friends, and her past life. She prayed desperately, asking God how long she would have to endure this torment. She even prayed for the executioners, pleading for their redemption.

Finally, as her awareness faded, Angela felt an overwhelming sense of cold emptiness—a final, chilling reminder of how loveless the day had become.

The executions continued for hours. Chainsaws buzzed relentlessly, their roar punctuated by the muffled cries of mourners. The final chainsaw powered off around midnight, leaving a suffocating silence in its wake.

By the next day, the gymnasium was spotless. Operators had dissolved the bodies, ground the bones, and scattered the remains outdoors, ensuring no trace was left. The mourners’ cars were sanitized, repurposed, or discarded without a trace of their owners.

Outside, the funeral procession continued with Secret Service agents driving some of the mourners’ vehicles. The former President's motorcade was given prominent placement. The public saw only a somber ceremony, unaware of the horrors within.

The truth of what transpired at Rev. Dr. Duke Stone's phantom funeral was erased—along with the lives of the mourners. The orchestrators had partially accomplished their goal: the elimination of Rev. Stone's associates to prevent discussion of his out-of-character and unexplained disappearances.
